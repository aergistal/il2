Operation features:  
- Airplane has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.  
- U17 strike modification includes C3 additional fuel injection system. When engaged, it increases pressure to 1.65 ATA (10 minutes time limit). This system can be turned on by engine boost command only at 100%25 throttle, with automatic propeller pitch control enabled and at altitudes lower than 1 km.  
- Outlet cowl shutters are operated manually.  
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash the propeller pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.  
- When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.  
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- Airplane has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.  
- Airplane has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons and indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may also be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.  
- Airplane has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.  
- Airplane has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or rear fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).  
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows for dropping bombs one by one.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:  
- Engine is equipped with the automatic governor of the manifold pressure that works when the throttle is set to 1/3 position or above. It is neccessary to turn the automatic governor off to set the boost value to +16.  
- Engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.  
- Engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to the backward position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight move the mixture lever to forward position.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor that controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- The water radiator is operated manually, while the oil radiator is unadjustable.  
- Aircraft has a neutral static stability. The elevator effectiveness is high, so the aircraft should be controlled carefully, not giving too much flight stick input.  
- Aircraft becomes unstable with extended landing flaps.  
- Aircraft is equipped with elevator and rudder trimmers.  
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator so they can be extended to maximum position only. Speed with extended landing flaps is limited to 150 mph.  
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. Since the landing gear wheels are relatively close to each other, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- Airplane is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.  
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- Airplane is equipped with upper and bottom formation lights which can be turned on simultaneously or independently.  
- The gunsight is adjustable: both the target distance and target base can be set.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:  
- The boost regulator on an airplane works only as a boost limiter. The regulator limits the nominal boost to 1140 mmHg at the first stage of the supercharger operation and 950 mmHg at the second stage of the supercharger operation.  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3500m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to maximum. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiator, air cooling intake and outlet shutters are manually controlled.  
- Air cooling intake shutters should always be open. They should only be closed when there is a possibility of engine overcooling, for example in a dive with idle throttle.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for pitch and yaw controls.  
- The aircraft has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.  
- The aircraft tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.  
- The canopy has an emergency jettison for bailing out at a high speed.  
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop the two bombs at the same time.

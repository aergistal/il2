Operation features:  
- The engine has no manifold pressure automatic governor. For this reason, manifold pressure not only depends on throttle position, but also from RPM and altitude. This requires additional checking of manifold pressure to not cause engine damage.  
- The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (66%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set mixture lever to Auto Lean (33%25) position. In the case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Emergency (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Idle Cut Off (0%25) position.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiators and engine cowl outlet shutters are manually operated.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.  
- The aircraft is equipped with formation, navigation and landing lights.  
- The engine has a one-stage mechanical supercharger.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I).  
- The aircraft has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The unlocked tailwheel has no turn limit. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft is equipped with three-channel autopilot system (main switch RAlt + A). Pilot has the ability to trim course (RAlt + Left/Right), pitch (RAlt + Up/Down) and roll (RShift + Left/Right) stabilizing angles.  
- Cargo unload doors can be opened on the ground only.  
- The left passenger door must be removed before flight for dropping paratroopers or cargo containers. Use the bomb drop button ("B" by default) to drop them.

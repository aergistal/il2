Combat debut: June 1941  
  
Operation features:  
- Engine has a boost mode. To set boost mode it is necessary to push the boost lever fully forward and increase the engine to 2300 RPM.  
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which should be manually shifted at 3000m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to maximum. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiator shutter and air cooling intake shutters control is manual.  
- Airplane has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- Airplane has a manual system for landing flaps and gear, for this reason it is necessary to extend landing flaps and gear before final approach. Landing flaps can be extended to any angle up to 53°.  
- Airplane has a tail wheel control mechanism which is linked to rudder pedals. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid of large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed on the ground.  
- Airplane has independent left and right mechanical wheel brakes. To brake it is necessary to push upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- Airplane has a hydrostatic fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining only when manual sucker lever is pushed in. In game this happens by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds.  
- Cockpit has side-doors which should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage.  
- When bombs are installed there is a salvo controller, it has two release modes: single drop or drop two in a salvo.  
- When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter. There is also a back-up folding mechanical sight which can be used if main sight is damaged.

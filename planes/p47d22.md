Operation features:  
- In addition to the automatic single stage supercharger, the engine is equipped with a turbocharger that the pilot can control.  
- The turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust back pressure which can be set by a lever in the cockpit and maintained automatically using the throttle shutters on the exhaust pipes.  
- The air compressed in the turbocharger goes to the intercooler where it is cooled by the incoming airflow. The cool compressed air goes to the carburetor and the resulting fuel-air mixture goes to the supercharger.  
- The temperature of the air after the intercooler is indicated by a separate gauge. The pilot can control the intercooler flaps using the toggle switch and observe their position using the indicator on the left. Their default position is neutral (50%).  
- The turbocharger RPM is controlled by the lever in the cockpit ("Left Shift" and "+"/"-" keys by default). At the back lever position the throttle shutters are fully open and exhaust gases all go to the atmosphere, resulting in minimal turbocharger RPM. At the forward lever position, the exhaust back pressure and the resulting turbocharger RPM are at maximum. It should be noted that the RPM will change with the altitude even if the lever is kept in the same position. The turbocharger RPM is indicated by a dedicated gauge.  
- The total engine power should be controlled using the joint method when the three levers - RPM lever, throttle lever and turbocharger lever are moved together. However, in certain cases (for instance, when going higher than the critical altitude) the turbocharger lever should be adjusted separately.  
- It should be noted that turbocharger RPM changes relatively slowly and not immediately after the control lever adjustment.  
- The aircraft is equipped with the water injection system that boosts the power in the emergency mode. When this system is engaged, the exhaust back pressure and turbocharger RPM increase automatically while the mixture becomes leaner. The water supply is good for around 7 minutes at the emergency power.  
- The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if the mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (85%) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set the mixture lever to Auto Lean (60%) position. In the case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%) position.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiators shutters are manually operated.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 40°.  
- It is forbidden to open the cowl flaps at speeds exceeding 225 mph, perform sharp maneuvers with the opened cowl shutters and dive with the opened intercooler shutters.  
- The aircraft has a manual control for the tailwheel lock. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.  
- The signal lamp lights up when the landing gear is up and the throttle is in the backward position or when the landing gear is down, but the throttle is in the forward position.  
- It should be noted that the aircraft requires a long takeoff run - around 650 meters at standard load and 1500 meters at maximum takeoff weight. It is possible to lower the flaps to 10-20 degrees to shorten the takeoff run.   
- The aircraft is equipped with one fuel gauge, but two indicator needles for the forward and rear fuel tanks.  
- The engine consumes much fuel at the combat power mode - around 4.5 gallons per minute.  
- The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The aircraft is equipped with the manual bomb release system for each of the three bomb racks.  
- The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch.  
- There is a backup mechanical sight which can be used if the main sight is damaged.

Operation features:  
- COMBAT, AEROBATIC MANEUVERS AND INSTRUMENT FLYING ARE FORBIDDEN AT FULL FUEL RESERVE! The aircraft is unstable with full rear fuel tank. This limit is lifted when there is no more than 20 gallons (around 75%25 fuel left) in the rear tank. This tank is completely empty at 68%25 total fuel level.  
- It is possible to reach dangerously high Mach numbers in a dive: the aircraft starts to shake and the loss of control is possible. Reduce the throttle and gently return to a horizontal flight.  
- The engine is equipped with the automatic governor of the manifold pressure that works when the throttle is set to 1/3 position or above.  
- The engine has a two stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control. It can be switched to the low gear manually.  
- The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if the mixture lever is set to RUN (70%25) position. In the case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%25) position.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor that controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- The water and oil radiators shutters are operated automatically, but there is a manual mode.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and can be extended to 10°, 20°, 30°, 40° or 50°.  
- Each tank has a dedicated fuel level indicator: wing tank inidicators are located on the cockpit floor and the rear tank indicator is behind the pilot seat on the left.  
- The tail wheel rotates freely, but moving the control stick back locks it so it rotates by the pedals input.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.  
- The signal lamp lights up when the landing gear is up and the throttle is in the backward position or when the landing gear is down, but the throttle is in the forward position.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.  
- It is impossible to open the canopy at high speeds because of the ram air, but there is an emergency jettison handle for bailing out.  
- The aircraft is equipped with formation lights.  
- The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch.  
- The gyroscopic gunsight automatically calculates required angular deflection while firing at a target. It has 3 modes: fixed reticle, fixed and gyro reticle, gyro reticle. The angular deflection will be calculated correctly only if the target range is set properly. To set the range, adjust the target base first using separate controls and then set the range by adjusting the size of the range-finding reticle to be the same as the target size.

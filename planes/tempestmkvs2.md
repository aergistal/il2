Operation features:  
- The engine is equipped with the two-stage mechanical supercharger which should be manually switched at 9500ft altitude.  
- The engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to NORMAL (1/2) position. It should be set to START (forward, throttle lever movement will be limited by 1/10) position when starting the engine and to CUT-OUT position (back) to stop it.  
- The engine has an automatic RPM governor that controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.   
- Water and oil temperatures are controlled manually by adjusting the radiator shutters.  
- The aircraft has pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.  
- Landing flaps have hydraulic actuators and can be extended to any angle up to 80°. The speed with the extended flaps is limited to 160 mph.  
- The airplane tailwheel rotates freely and does not have a lock.  
- The pneumatic brakes are differential: moving the pedals with brakes pressed results in releasing the brake opposite to the pressed pedal.  
- The landing gear indicator lamp lights up if the throttle is set to low (less than 1/3) position with the landing gear retracted.  
- It is impossible to open the canopy at high speeds because of the ram air, but there is an emergency jettison handle for bailing out.  
- The aircraft is equipped with bottom formation lights.  
- The range-finding gunsight reticle can be adjusted for a given target base and range.  
  
Basic data and recommended positions of the aircraft controls:  
1. Starting the engine:  
	- recommended position of the mixture control lever: Start  
	- recommended position of the radiator control handle: close  
	- recommended position of the prop pitch control handle: 100%  
	- recommended position of the throttle lever: 10%  
  
2. Recommended mixture control lever positions for various flight modes: Normal (auto mixture control)  
  
3. Recommended positions of the radiator control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open

Combat debut: Autumn 1942  
  
Operation features:  
- The aircraft has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.  
- Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually. The oil radiator control has five fixed positions. The water radiator control has nine fixed positions.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I).  
- Propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.  
- To reduce swinging during taxiing due to prop-wash it is necessary to use asymmetrical engines thrust. It is recommended to give the left engine 20% more power. Also, the prop pitch control should be switched to manual mode and pitch should be reduced to minimum.  
- The aircraft has only pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.  
- The aircraft has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°.  
- The aircraft has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps.  
- The aircraft tailwheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows the remaining fuel in one of four fuel tanks depending on the switch position. Also, the airplane has a low fuel warning light (50 liters) for each tank.  
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an automatic bomb salvo controller, it allows you to choose which bomb-racks to be released (central belly, left and right wing) and to switch the bomb salvo (single release or release all bombs).  
- Reloading of BK37 gun is performed by the rear gunner at the pilot`s command.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

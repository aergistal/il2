Wingspan: 25.2 m  
Wing surface: 79.25 m²  
  
Combat debut: July 1943  
  
Operation features:  
- The glider is equipped with a towing mechanism with a detachable cable. The cable could be released upon command from the glider pilot, or from the pilot of the towing aircraft (by default, LShift+D).  
- The airframe has interceptor spoilers with a manual mechanical drive, which, when released (by default, RAlt+B), reduce the lift of the wing and increase the drag, thereby shortening the glide path.  
- The front part of the glider is a crew cabin, which on the ground can be tilted upward for loading and unloading cargo or troops.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right pneumatic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The airplane tailwheel rotates freely and does not have a lock.  
- To provide shorter landing run drogue chute could be installed as modification. Maximum speed of drogue chute release (LAlt + D) is 225 km/h. After successfull landing and braking drogue chute should be jettisoned (LAlt + D).

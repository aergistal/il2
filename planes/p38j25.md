Operation features:  
- In addition to the automatic single-stage supercharger, each engine is equipped with the automatic turbo-supercharger.  
- The turbo-supercharger is powered by the engine exhaust backpressure and is regulated automatically by the pilot throttle control in the cockpit using the shutters on the exhaust pipes.  
- It should be noted that turbocharger RPM changes relatively slowly and not immediately after a control lever adjustment. For instance, during takeoff it's necessary to keep the brakes pressed for several seconds after moving the throttle to takeoff position and begin the run only when the turbocharger RPM increases sufficiently to reach 54 inches of pressure.  
- The automatic fuel mixture control maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (70%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce the fuel consumption during flight set the mixture lever to Auto Lean (30%25) position. In a case of malfunction of the automatic mixture control, the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (move the lever completely forward) position. To stop the engine, set it to the Idle Cut Off (0%25) position.  
- The automatic engine governor keeps the set engine RPM by adjusting the propeller pitch using an electric actuator (it is possible to turn it off and control the propeller pitch manually). The propellers can be feathered.  
- The aircraft has pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and can be extended to any angle up to 40°. There is also a fixed "maneuver" flaps position that can be set by a short flaps button press ("F" by default).  
- The aircraft is equipped with hydraulic aileron actuators, making their operation and good roll performance at high speeds possible. The actuators are turned on using a special valve on the left side of the cockpit and require at least 1200 psi pressure in the hydraulic system, so they should be turned off if there is only one engine running. In the sim, they are turned on and off automatically.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.  
- The landing gear indicator lamp lights up if the landing gear is neither extended nor retracted. The extension of the nose wheel can also be checked by its reflection in the mirrors on the inner sides of the engine nacelles and by the pressure drop in the hydraulic system during the landing gear operation.  
- There are signal lamps warning about the low fuel level in the outer wing tanks (the primary fuel source) and separate fuel indicators for the left and right fuel tank pairs.  
- The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The windows on the sides of the canopy can be lowered during flight, but this can cause the excessive shaking of the plane.  
- The electric bomb controller allows dropping the bombs one by one from the left and right racks or by pairs.  
- The unguided rockets are launched using the electric controller which allows single, pair, triple and salvo (all rockets at 0.1 seconds interval) launch. The rocket containers are jettisonable.

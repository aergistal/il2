Operation features:  
- The aircraft is equipped with two turbojet engines Jumo-004 B1. They are controlled automatically by the throttle which sets the turbine rotor RPM.  
- The engine is equipped with automatic fuel regulator that engaged only at more than 6000 RPM. Therefore, the fuel regulation at lower RPM wasn\'t effective and a careless throttle increase could cause excessive fuel intake, resulting in overheating and possible engine fire.  
- At high altitudes it is possible to lean the mixture too much by a sharp throttle decrease, causing a flameout and engine stop. The turbine shouldn\'t be set below 6000-8000 RPM depending on the altitude.  
- It is impossible to restart the engine at high altitudes (more than 4000 m).  
- The aircraft is equipped with horizontal stabilizer and rudder trim to reduce the load on controls.  
- The aircraft is susceptible to Mach tuck when diving at 0.84 M or higher speed.   
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 55°. The hydraulic valve controlling the flaps can\'t be turned during the landing gear operation (lowering or retracting).  
- Landing gear brakes are hydraulic as well and are engaged by pushing a corresponding pedal. The nose gear orients by itself (up to 50° in either direction), has a rotation dampener and dedicated brake handle. The aircraft tends to rotate during a breakaway unless the nose wheel is set forward.  
- There are two main (900 l each) and two secondary fuel tanks (600 and 170 l). The fuel transfer from secondary to main tanks using the electric fuel pump is initiated by the pilot when the fuel level in main tanks drops lower than 600 l. The main tanks have fuel level indicators and emergency fuel lamps (they light up when there are less than 250 l left).  
  
Basic data and recommended positions of the aircraft controls:  
1. Starting the engine:  
	- recommended position of the mixture control lever: auto mixture control  
	- recommended position of the throttle lever: 0%  
  
2. Recommended mixture control lever positions for various flight modes: auto mixture control  
  
3. Recommended positions of the radiator/cowl flap control handle for various flight modes:  no radiators/cowl flaps  
  
4. Approximate fuel consumption at 2000 m altitude:  
	- Cruise engine mode: 18.8 l/min  
	- Combat engine mode: 28.3 l/min

**Fuel regulating valve**  
This automatic valve in the fuel line limits an excessive fuel pressure caused by a rapid throttle increase, preventing the overheating and the resulting destruction of the engine. It almost completely removed the danger of engine fire from careless throttle inputs.  
It was installed on Jumo-004 B1 engines during routine maintenance since the end of 1944.

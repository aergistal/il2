Operation features:  
- The aircraft has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.  
- The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode.  
- Radiator flaps are controlled automatically, keeping a set coolant temperature. This temperature can be set by a pilot using the thermostat regulator if needed (default 0%25 setting is adequate for all engine modes, while increasing it cools the engine more).  
- When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.  
- The aircraft has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- The aircraft has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.  
- The aircraft has electrically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (13°) and landing (58°). Flaps control buttons are located on left panel near the throttle. The flap angle may be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.  
- The aircraft has a tail wheel lock system which locks the tail wheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I). Also, the airplane has an emergency fuel warning light (100 liters).  
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The standard bomb release controller allows dropping the bombs only one by one.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

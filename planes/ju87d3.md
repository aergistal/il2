Combat debut: March 1942  
  
Operation features:  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an automatic switch system that switches gears depending on altitude and engine revolutions. It can also be manually switched to first gear.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.  
- The aircraft has only the pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.  
- The aircraft has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.  
- The aircraft has hydraulic-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (25°) and landing (40°). Flap indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle.  
- The aircraft is also equipped with differential ailerons which are lowered in synch with the flaps.  
- The aircraft has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps. The stabilizer control lamps are located near the throttle lever.  
- The aircraft has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in left and right fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I). Also, the airplane has indicator lights for full internal tanks and a low fuel warning light (160 liters) for each tank.  
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. When the canopy is open, it is impossible to use rear gun because it is linked to canopy. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The aircraft has a window in the cockpit floor which can be opened by the bomb bay door command.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a salvo controller, it allows the pilot to choose which bomb racks to use (central, left and right wing) and to switch the bomb salvo (single drop or all bombs on the rack).  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.  
- The aircraft is equipped with dive system. When the dive system is engaged, the plane enters a dive when the air brakes are extended and will recover from the dive either by pressing the bomb drop button or when the air brakes are retracted. The dive system controls are separate: the trimmer tab on the right elevator is controlled by the dive system while the pilot controls the trimmer tab on the left elevator. Therefore the pilot input and dive system input of the trimmers are independent, and when the dive system is in operation, there is no indication of a trimmer position change in the technochat.

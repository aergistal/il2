Operation features:  
- The aircraft has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight.  
- Water temperature are controlled manually by adjusting the radiator shutters.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- The aircraft has fence-type airbrakes which are located above and under the wing and are used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.  
- The aircraft has hydraulically-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (20°) and landing (50°). Flaps control buttons and indicator lights are located on left panel near the throttle. The speed with the extended flaps is limited to 300 km/h.  
- The aircraft has automatic wing slats. They deploy when the high angle of attack increases which makes pre-stall softer.  
- The aircraft has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts  
- The aircraft is equipped with bottom formation lights which can be turned on simultaneously.  
- The aircraft has dive bombsight Stuvi 5B by default. Pilot should set target height above sea level (RShift + Period/Semicolon) and wind speed (RAlt + Period/Semicolon) before initiating the dive.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has two release modes: drop single or drop all bombs in salvo.  
- When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.

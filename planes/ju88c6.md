Operation features:  
- Each engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an automatic switch system that switches gears depending altitude and engine revolutions. It can also be manually switched to first gear.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.  
- Water and oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated. Ground personnel may install additional fixed shutters on the intake of the oil radiators in cold weather to prevent freezing of the oil.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I).  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- The aircraft has hydraulic-actuated landing flaps with three fixed positions: retracted, takeoff (25°) and landing (50°). Flap indicator lights are located on left panel.  
- The aircraft has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps. The stabilizer control lamps are located near the flaps indicator lights.  
- The aircraft is also equipped with differential ailerons which are lowered in synch with the flaps.  
- Lowering the landing gear takes a long time, for this reason it is necessary to extend the landing gear well before final landing approach.  
- The aircraft tailwheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has dedicated fuel gauges for left and right fuel tank groups and there is a switch between the internal and external fuel tank group indicator. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight every 10 seconds. Also, the airplane has low fuel warning lights (180 liters) for the internal tanks.  
- Aiming line of forward-firing armament is set at an elevation angle of -4.5 degrees.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an automatic bomb salvo controller, it allows you to switch between the bomb racks to be released (internal or external) and to switch between different salvo quantities. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.

4. Approximate fuel consumption at 2000 m altitude:  
	- Cruise engine mode: 10.5 l/min

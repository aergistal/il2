Operation features:  
- Each engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an automatic switch system that switches gears depending altitude and engine revolutions. It can also be manually switched to first gear.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.  
- Water and oil radiator shutter controls are manual. The oil radiator control has five fixed positions.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.  
- The aircraft tailwheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has dedicated fuel gauges for left and right fuel tank groups and there is a switch between the internal and external fuel tank group indicator. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I). Also, there is dedicated fuel gauge for the fuselage fuel tank. Also, the airplane has low fuel warning lights (200 liters) for left and right fuel tank groups.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an automatic bomb salvo controller, it allows you to switch between the bomb racks to be released (internal or external) and to switch between different salvo quantities. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.

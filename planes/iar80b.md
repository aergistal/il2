Combat debut: Autumn 1942  
  
Operation features:  
- The aircraft has no constant propeller governor. The propeller speed is controlled by manually changing the propeller pitch using a switch on the instrument board (default propeller pitch commands in the sim are [RShift + +/-]).  
- Due to the absence of a constant propeller speed governor, it is necessary to carefully monitor the propeller RPM, especially in a dive - due to the spinning up of the propeller during acceleration, it is possible to exceed the maximum RPM and cause an engine failure.  
- The aircraft has no cylinder head temperature gauge - only an oil temperature gauge.  
- The oil radiator of the I.A.R. 80-B has no regulation (there is a second adjustable oil radiator on I.A.R. 80-C, I.A.R. 81-C modification).  
- The aircraft is equipped with elevator trimmer.  
- Mixture control is automated, the automatic regulator maintains the set mixture composition and automatically enriches the mixture at low and full throttle. The optimum mixture is set by the centre position of the control lever.  
- The flaps are hydraulic and can be set to any angle up to 75°. In the dive bomber version, the fully released flaps are used as air brake. There is no flap position indicator.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has a hydrostatic fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining only when manual sucker lever is pushed in. In the sim, hold [RShift+I by default].  
- To drop bombs, you must switch on the bomb releasel system first [N key]. After dropping bombs, the system should be manually deactivated.  
- When the bomb release system is switched on, the flaps are automatically fully released as an air brake and retract automatically either when the bomb release button is pressed or when the system is switched off.  
- The bomb release system can either drop only the central bomb or all three bombs at once.  
- The gunsight is adjustable: both the target distance and target base can be set.  
- In the dive bomber version, the tilt of the gunsight is adjustable [RAlt + F by default].  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter [LAlt + F by default].  
  
Basic data and recommended positions of the aircraft controls:  
1. Starting the engine:  
	- recommended position of the mixture control lever: 50% auto mixture control  
	- recommended position of the cowl flap control handle: close  
	- recommended position of the prop pitch control handle: heavy  
	- recommended position of the throttle lever: 0%  
  
2. Recommended mixture control lever positions for various flight modes: 50% (auto mixture control)  
  
3. Recommended positions of the cowl flap control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open 100%  
	- climb: open 100%  
	- cruise flight: open 20% (in winter conditions - close if necessary)  
	- combat: open 50%  
  
4. Approximate fuel consumption at 2000 m altitude:  
	- Cruise engine mode: 6.9 l/min  
	- Combat engine mode: 7.7 l/min

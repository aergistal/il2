Operation features:  
- The aircraft has a wide automatization of the engine systems, in fact, to control speed it is only necessary to use the throttle lever. There is no need to manually set engine revolutions and mixture or supercharger gear in normal flight. The engine supercharger has an automatic switch system which depends on altitude and engine revolutions.  
- The aircraft is equipped with MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system that prevents the engine detonation in the emergency power mode. The system is activated by the pilot at altitudes up to 10000 m. The total operating duration of the MW-50 water-methanol mixture injection system is 28 minutes. Also, the airplane has a MW-50 warning light which shows no injection (over the engine RPM gauge).  
- The aircraft is equipped with GM-1 nitrous oxide injection system that provides the engine with additional oxygen. Nitrous oxide allows to fly above the rated altitude of the engine. The system is activated by the pilot at altitudes from 11000 m. The total operating duration of the GM-1 nitrous oxide injection system is 17 minutes. Consumption rate: 100 g/sec.  
- Radiator flaps are controlled automatically, keeping a set coolant temperature. This temperature can be set by a pilot using the thermostat regulator if needed (default 0% setting is adequate for all engine modes, while increasing it cools the engine more).  
- When the angle of attack increases to critical levels the wing may stall suddenly and unexpectedly. There is almost no pre-stall buffet before the stalling. To avoid this the pilot must pay additional attention when performing extreme maneuvering.  
- The aircraft has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- The aircraft has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer which is electrically-actuated. It should be set to +1.5° before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 73°. The flap angle may be checked by indicators on the left and right wing outside the cockpit.  
- The aircraft has a tailwheel lock system which locks the tailwheel if the flight-stick is pulled backward. The tailwheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance, before takeoff and after touchdown upon landing.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in main fuselage fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I). There are no fuel gauges for the wing tanks. Supplementary fuel flows into the rear fuselage tank. Also, the airplane has emergency fuel warning lights. The white warning light flashes when the rear tank supply has dropped to about 10 liters. The red warning light flashes when the supply in the front tank has dropped to about 80 liters.  
- The aircraft has a cockpit pressure gauge and cockpit ventilation switch. Compressed air is pumped into the cockpit at 8000 m altitude automatically. In the case of pressurized ventilation, a constant overpressure (0.1-0.2 atu) should normally be achieved in the cockpit. Also, the airplane has a cockpit depressurization warning light (at the top of the instrument panel).  
- It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.

Operation features:  
- The aircraft is equipped with two turbojet engines Jumo-004 B1. They are controlled automatically by the throttle which sets the turbine rotor RPM.  
- The engine is equipped with automatic fuel regulator that engaged only at more than 6000 RPM. Therefore, the fuel regulation at lower RPM wasn\'t effective and a careless throttle increase could cause excessive fuel intake, resulting in overheating and possible engine fire.  
- At high altitudes it is possible to lean the mixture too much by a sharp throttle decrease, causing a flameout and engine stop. The turbine shouldn\'t be set below 6000-8000 RPM depending on the altitude.  
- It is impossible to restart the engine at high altitudes (more than 4000 m).  
- The aircraft is equipped with horizontal stabilizer and rudder trim to reduce the load on controls.  
- The aircraft is susceptible to Mach tuck when diving at 0.8 M or higher speed.   
- Landing flaps and hovering ailerons have a hydraulic actuator. Thay can be extended in take-off position (flaps angle 25°) and landing position (flaps angle 45°).  
- Landing gear brakes are hydraulic as well and are engaged by pushing a corresponding pedal. The nose gear orients by itself.  
- There are two fuel tanks (1800 l and 1990 l) which have fuel level indicators and emergency fuel lamps (they light up when there are less than 250 l left).  
- The aircraft is equipped with three-channel autopilot system (main switch RAlt + A, each channel could be activated independently by RAlt + Y/P/R). Pilot has the ability to trim course (RAlt + Left/Right) and pitch (RAlt + Up/Down) stabilizing angles.  
- The aircraft has dive bombsight BZA 1 B by default (LShift + V). Pilot should set target height above sea level (RShift + Period/Semicolon) and wind speed (RAlt + Period/Semicolon) before initiating the dive. Head of dive bombsight periscope could change its orientation to provide rear-view to the pilot (RAlt + F). Reticle lights could be switched off (LAlt + M). Also bombsight Lotfe 7K for horizontal bombing could be installed as modification.  
- The aircraft has a significant takeoff run (especially with a maximum takeoff weight). To provide shorter takeoff run parachuted jet boosters could be installed as modification. Nominal operating time of jet boosters is 35 s (press R to activate). After successfull takeoff jet boosters should be jettisoned (LShift + D).  
- To provide shorter landing run drogue chute could be installed as modification. Maximum speed of drogue chute release (LAlt + D) is 215 km/h. After successfull landing and braking drogue chute should be jettisoned (LAlt + D).  
- To be able to fly reconnaissance missions aircraft could be equipped with photo equipment. Photobay doors must be opened before taking shots of reconnaissance area (control is the same as the bomb doors).

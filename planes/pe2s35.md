Operation features:  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2700m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM. The governor is electrically actuated and takes a long time to reach the required revolutions, up to 45 seconds when going from minimum to maximum.  
- Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- The aircraft has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and are used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an automatic dive system. When the dive system is engaged, the plane enters a dive when the airbrakes are extended (passing through the 45 ° position) and will recover from the dive when you either press the bomb drop button or the dive recovery button to exit the dive (LCtrl + D by default). The dive system controls the elevator trim - for correct operation, the trimmer must be in the range between -4.5 ° to +4.5 ° before turning on the dive system. If the trimmer is outside this range, the aircraft has been trimmed manually, or if the airbrakes are retracted while the dive system is engaged, the dive system will be turned off.  
- Landing flaps have electro-hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°. When landing and the flaps are fully extended the angle of attack for a stall is less than landing pitch angle. For this reason, it is prohibited to extend flaps to more than to 35° (70%25) on landing.  
- The aircraft has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps.  
- The aircraft tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has three fuel gauges which shows the level in the fuselage fuel tank, left wing tanks and right wing tanks.  
- The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.  
- When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo. Aircraft has a fire control system that is designed for eight rockets. However, for added punch, ten rockets were typically loaded. In that case, the ninth rocket will fire with the seventh and the tenth will fire with the eighth.

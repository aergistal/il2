Operation features:  
- The engine has no manifold pressure automatic governor. For this reason, manifold pressure not only depends on throttle position, but also from RPM and altitude. This requires additional checking of manifold pressure to not cause engine damage.  
- The engine is equipped with an automatic fuel mixture control which maintains optimal mixture if mixture lever is set to Auto Rich (66%25) position. To use automatic mixture leaning to reduce fuel consumption during flight it is necessary to set mixture lever to Auto Lean (33%25) position. In the case of mulfunction of the automatic mixture control the mixture lever should be set to Full Rich (100%25) position. To stop the engine mixture lever should be set to the Cut Off (0%25) position.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiators shutters are joint with engine cowl outlet shutters and manually operated.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by pressing (RShift+I).  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a parking brake system.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a siren that warns a pilot if the throttle is set to low position with landing gear retracted.  
- The aircraft is equipped with upper formation lights.  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2900m (9500 ft) altitude.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows remaining fuel in left and right fuel tanks depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 15 seconds.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an electromechanical safety system that blocks the hydraulic landing gear actuator while the aircraft is on the ground.  
- The nose gear orients by itself, doesn't have brakes and can't be controlled.  
- It is forbidden to open the upper cowl flaps during flight, so they should be closed before taking off.  
- The upper cowl flaps are controlled simultaneously using a shared hydraulic actuator (use inlet shutter control ingame).  
- There are white and red signal lamps in the tail: the white one is lit while bomb doors are open and the red one lights up for 5 seconds when bombs are released.  
- The upper cockpit door can't be opened during flight, but there is an emergency jettison handle.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a bomb salvo controller that has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.

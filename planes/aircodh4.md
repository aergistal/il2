## Description

Designed by Geoffrey de Havilland to be a two-seat light bomber powered by a BHP engine. First prototype flew in August 1916, but as the BHP engine proved to be weak it required a major redesign and DH.4 was adapted to be equipped with a Rolls Royce Eagle engine. First order for 50 planes powered by Eagle III engine (250hp) was placed at the end of 1916.  
  
Basically an all-wooden construction tractor biplane, Airplane armament consisted of one forward-firing Vickers synchronized machine gun and one or two Lewis guns on the Scarff ring mount at the observer position. It could carry up to 460 pounds of bombs on external racks on wings or central position.  
  
Due to shortages of Rolls Royce engines the production airplanes were also fitted with BHP (230hp), RAF3A (200hp), the Siddeley Puma (230hp) and the 260hp Fiat, yet none of the alternative powered DH.4\'s could match the Rolls Royce powered machines. First DH.4 in frontline service were supplied to No.55 squadron on March 1917; it was the first RFC squadron fully equipped with this type. Till the end of 1917, a total of 6 squadrons were equipped with DH.4\'s. It also was used by RNAS squadrons for naval operations for recon and anti-submarine use.  
  
Reported to be pleasant to fly and easy to operate, the crews loved it because of its speed and maneuverability (the only "flaw" noted by its crews was the fuel tank placed between pilot and observer cockpits which caused communication problems between them). Due to its abilities, it was often used without fighter cover as its speed and good altitude performance allowed it to survive. Mostly used as a light day-bomber, it also could carry radio equipment for artillery observation duties and camera equipment for photo-reconnaissance missions.  
  
Produced by Airco, F.W. Berwick and Co, Glendower Aircraft Company, Palladium Autocars, Vulcan Motor and Engineering, and the Westland Aircraft Works in the UK, a total of 1,449 aircraft were built in the UK for the RFC and RNAS through the end of the war.

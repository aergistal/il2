The U-2 aircraft was developed under N.N. Polikarpov supervision in 1923-1928. It was designed as a simple, sturdy, and easy to handle two-seater aircraft for flight schools. It went airborne for the first time on June 24, 1927, but many improvements to its design were made afterwards to improve its climb rate. The upgraded plane went into production in 1929 after the first flight on January 7, 1928.  
  
Flight instructors and pilot candidates liked the plane - it forgave the typical mistakes of the trainees, was hard to stall and easy to recover, predictable at high angles of attack and had a low landing speed. Many future aces learned to fly in this \'flying school-desk\'. It was the first aircraft for the majority of VVS pilots.  
  
Several modifications of this aircraft were developed: ambulance S-1 and S-2, passenger U-2SP and U-2L, agriculture U-2AP and military U-2VS. The military modification could carry up to 300 kg of bombs and was equipped with a defensive MG turret. During WWII, it was mainly used as a low-altitude bomber and recon plane. It was a very hard target for enemy fighters at low altitudes because of its low speed, resulting in its relatively high survivability rate. It was used by the famous "night witches", female pilots and navigators of 46th Guards night bomber regiment. The model was renamed to Po-2 to honor N.N. Polikarpov after his passing in 1944.  
  
Operational features:  
- There is no engine supercharger.  
- The fuel mixture control is manual: the mixture should be leaned as the altitude increases for optimal engine functioning and to reduce the fuel consumption while flying level.  
- The fixed pitch propeller requires controlling the engine RPM manually.  
- The tail skid is linked to the rudder (8° maximum tilt).  
- There are no wheel brakes.  
- There is no electric generator in the default aircraft configuration, so electric lights and Pitot tube warmer (which consumes up to 226W) are fed from 24V battery (10 Ah capacity at 1 A current in standard conditions). To power the RSI-4 radio station, GS-10-350 electric generator is installed along with it.  
- Please note that with all possible modifications and full fuel the total aircraft weight is 1390 kg, more than its maximum takeoff weight.

## Modifications

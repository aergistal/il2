Combat debut: May 1942  
  
Operation features:  
- Engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 2300m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Water radiator shutter control is manual. Oil radiator shutters are fixed.  
- Airplane has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Airplane has fence-type airbrakes which are located under the wing and used to slow the descent during steep dive bombing.  
- Landing flaps have electro-hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 50°. When landing and the flaps are fully extended the angle of attack for a stall is less than landing pitch angle. For this reason, it is prohibited to extend flaps to more than to 35° (70%25) on landing.  
- Airplane has an automatically controlled horizontal stabilizer. An automatic control system adjusts the stabilizer angle depending on the extended angle of the landing flaps.  
- Airplane tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- Airplane has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- Airplane has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.  
- The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- Airplane is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has four release modes: drop single, drop two in a salvo, drop four in a salvo or drop all bombs in salvo. There is also a controller for a drop delay between each bomb in the salvo.  
- When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo. Aircraft has a fire control system that is designed for eight rockets. However, for added punch, ten rockets were typically loaded. In that case, the ninth rocket will fire with the seventh and the tenth will fire with the eighth.

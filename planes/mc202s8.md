Combat debut: June 1942  
  
Operation features:  
- Throttle lever is inverted: backward = full throttle, forward = idle throttle.  
- The engine is equipped with automatic mixture control system and supercharger with fluid coupling which does not require manual control.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor with two fixed modes: 2200 RPM normal mode, 2400 RPM boosted mode. Also, it is possible to turn off the governor and control the propeller pitch manually by mechanical actuator.  
- Water and oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.  
- The aircraft has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- The aircraft has asymmetric half-wings for roll-compensation: the left one is 20 cm longer than right one.  
- The aircraft has a manually controlled horizontal stabilizer. It should be set to neutral before takeoff and landing. Also, it may be used to trim the flight stick during the flight. In a deep dive the stabilizer should be set so that the pilot must push the flight stick forward to maintain the dive angle.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 45°. The flap system includes a "pneumatic spring" which allows flaps to be pressed upwards by airflow at airspeed more than 200 km/h.  
- The aircraft has a manual tailwheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which indicates only the front fuel tank level.  
- The design of the cockpit canopy does not allow it to be opened during flight. The canopy should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage. The canopy has an emergency release system for bailouts.  
- The control system for the bomb rack only allows to drop bombs one by one.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter. There is also a back-up folding mechanical sight which can be used if main sight is damaged.

	- cruise flight: open 100% (in winter conditions - open 50%)  
	- combat: open 50%  
  
3.2 Recommended positions of the water radiators control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open 100%

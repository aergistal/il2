Combat debut: early 1943  
  
Operation features:  
- The engine has a boost mode which is engaged by setting mixture control lever to maximum position.  
- The engine has a single stage mechanical supercharger which does not require manual control.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to the intermediate (50%25) position. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the control lever to less than 50%25. This will lower fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Water and oil radiator shutter control is manual. Airplane has armoured oil radiator shutters which should be closed at the beginning of ground attack to reduce a possibility of combat damage. After finishing the attack, it is necessary to re-open the shutters to the required position.  
- The aircraft has only the pitch flight-control trimmer.  
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can be extended fully or to takeoff position - 17°, gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before the landing which will cause the aircraft to shoot upwards.  
- The aircraft has a manual tail wheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows the amount of remaining fuel in the front or bottom fuel tank depending on switch position. In game the fuel indicator switch changes by itself during horizontal flight by every 10 seconds. Rear fuel tank level is not indicated.   
- Cockpit canopy weight is 50 kg and it has no lock in the open position, for this reason the canopy may to spontaneously close in a deep dive. Also, it is impossible to open or close canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a joint salvo controller both for bombs and rockets, it has three release/fire modes: single launch, launch two in a salvo or launch four in a salvo.  
- The mechanical gun sight "Visier Vladimirova" allows aiming rockets and guns at ground and air targets and horizontal bombing at certain speeds and altitudes.

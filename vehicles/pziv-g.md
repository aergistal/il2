## Description

This Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf.G with 75 mm KwK 40/L48 gun was made at Nibelungenwerke in June 1943. The main difference of the "Ausf.G" modification compared to previous ones was a new gun - longer (+5 calibers) barrel, but with the fixed turn of rifling instead of variable one.  
  
The most apparent visual difference was the addition of side armor plates, "Schürzen", which were attached to the hull and turret sides. They were added mainly to protect the tank from massed AT rifle fire which was dangerous for thinner armored sides. Not being able to stop an AP bullet, this additional armor destabilized it or caused its fragmentation before it could hit the main armored hull.  
  
It should be noted that this modification with additional 30 mm armor plates overlaying the front hull practically reached a limit of possible modernization - it was impossible to increase the protection of the turret in the same way. Roof and bottom armor thickness was reduced. However, while lacking armor protection, its gun was capable of hitting enemy tanks at 1 km distance or closer.  
  
Vomag, Nibelungenwerke, and Krupp-Grusonwerk made 1930 "G" modification tanks total. 588 of them were made at Nibelungenwerke and had an interesting peculiarity - their tracks were set up in a reverse direction.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
7,5 cm SprGr.34  
  
Good against soft, unarmored or lightly armored targets.  
  
Mass 5.74 kg, explosives mass 660 g.  
  
Direct hit armour penetration 20 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 3 m.  
  
When fired from a 7,5 cm KwK 40 L/48 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 550 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 509 m/s, drop -4.5 m.  
1000 m: velocity 473 m/s, drop -18.5 m.  
2000 m: velocity 405 m/s, drop -80.9 m.

**High Explosive Anti-Tank Shells**  
7,5 cm Gr.38 HL/C  
  
HEAT shells armed with high-explosive shaped charge warhead.  
  
Their armour piercing capability doesn't decrease with range, but accuracy does because of the lower projectile velocity and similar kinetic projectiles usually have a higher armour piercing capability up close.  
  
Mass 4.57 kg, explosives mass 530 g, armour penetration 104 mm.  
  
When fired from a 7,5 cm KwK 40 L/48:  
Muzzle velocity: 450 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 328 m/s, drop -7.8 m.  
1000 m: velocity 278 m/s, drop -38.1 m.  
2000 m: velocity 244 m/s, drop -200.4 m.

**Additional armor plates**  
Additional protection: 5 mm armored plates attached to the hull and turret. They were added mainly to protect the tank from massed AT rifle fire which was dangerous for thinner armored sides. Not being able to stop an AP bullet, this additional armor destabilized it or caused its fragmentation before it could hit the main armored hull.

**Armour Piercing High Explosive Shells**  
7,5 cm Pzgr. 39  
  
Shells armed with bursting charge warhead.  
  
Good against armoured targets. In case of penetration do more damage inside the target than solid AP shells, but HE filling can detonate prematurely (for instance, when used against spaced armour plates).  
  
Mass 6.8 kg, explosives mass 18 g.  
  
When fired from a 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 750 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 117 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 104 mm, velocity 691 m/s, drop -2.4 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 92 mm, velocity 636 m/s, drop -10.0 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 72 mm, velocity 537 m/s, drop -44.8 m.

**Sub-Caliber Armour Piercing Shells**  
7,5 cm Pzgr. 40  
  
Shells armed with sub-caliber armour-piercing projectile. Good against heavily armoured targets at short ranges.  
  
7,5 cm Pzgr. 40 is a composite round - hard (tungsten alloy) penetrator inside a body made from a softer steel (for obturation inside a gun barrel).  
  
Mass: 4.1 kg, penetrator calibre 28 mm.  
  
When fired from a 7,5 cm KwK 40 L/48 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 930 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 150 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 128 mm, velocity 832 m/s, drop -1.6 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 108 mm, velocity: 739 m/s, drop -10.0 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 75 mm, velocity: 573 m/s, drop -44.8 m.

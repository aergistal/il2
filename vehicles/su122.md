## Description

Assault gun SU-122 was produced at Ural Heavy Machinery Factory (UZTM) in Sverdlovsk from the end of December 1942 till August 1943 with 640 units built in total.   
  
It used Т-34-76 tank chassis, but the crew compartment has been completely rebuilt and the original turret was replaced with 122 mm M-30S howitzer. The suspension, engine compartment and the total weight of the vehicle remained the same, although the front armor slope was reduced. The assault gun was equipped with panoramic non-recoiling gunsight capable of direct fire for the gunner and PTK-5 panoramic visor for the commander.  
  
The assault guns made in early May 1943 like the one represented in the sim had a new traveling lock for the gun, different gunner cupola shutter mechanisms and a small hatch that made access to the right track tightener easier.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
OF-462  
  
Good against soft, unarmoured or lightly armoured targets.  
  
Mass 21.79 kg, explosives mass 3.67 kg.  
Direct hit armour penetration 44 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 6 m.  
  
When fired from a M-30S gun:  
Muzzle velocity: 515 m/s.  
500 m: velocity: 482 m/s, drop -5.1 m.  
1000 m: velocity: 451 m/s, drop -20.5 m.  
2000 m: velocity: 390 m/s, drop -91.1 m.

**High Explosive Anti-Tank Shells**  
BP-460A  
  
HEAT shells armed with high-explosive shaped charge warhead.  
  
Their armour piercing capability doesn't decrease with range, but accuracy does because of the lower projectile velocity and similar kinetic projectiles usually have a higher armour piercing capability up close.  
  
Mass 13.34 kg, explosives mass 2.15 kg, armour penetration 120 mm.  
  
When fired from a M-30S:  
Muzzle velocity: 335 m/s.  
500 m: velocity: 309 m/s, drop -11.7 m.  
1000 m: velocity: 284 m/s, drop -49.6 m.  
2000 m: velocity: 238 m/s, drop -224.6 m.

**Removed Fuel Tanks**  
The external rear-mounted fuel tanks oftenly were removed.

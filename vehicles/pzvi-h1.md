## Description

Developed by Henschel company in 1942, first combat action took place on Leningrad front in August 1942.  
  
The tank was famous for its powerful armour and 'square' look. Its wheels are placed in a checkered pattern to optimize ground pressure and provide additional protection for the hull sides, but this made the chassis repair complicated and often lead to a loss of a damaged tank.  
  
The main trump card of this machine was its powerful 88-mm long barelled gun KwK 36 developed on the base of the anti-air gun Flak 18/36. This weapon allowed Tigers to destroy enemy tanks at large distances - their firepower was unmatched on the battlefield until IS-2 heavy tanks appeared.  
  
Because of its advanced and complex design, Tigers were very expensive to produce (800 000 Reichsmarks, about two times more of the most other tanks of that time).  
  
Total 1354 Tiger tanks were produced since August 1942 till August 1944.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
8,8 cm Sprgr L/4,5  
  
Good against soft, unarmored or lightly armored targets.  
  
Mass 9.0 kg, explosives mass 900 g.  
  
Direct hit armour penetration 24 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 3 m.  
  
When fired from a 8,8 cm KwK 36 L/56 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 820 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 771 m/s, drop -2.0 m.  
1000 m: velocity 723 m/s, drop -8.1 m.  
2000 m: velocity 629 m/s, drop -35.5 m.

**High Explosive Anti-Tank Shells**  
8,8 cm Gr. 39 HL  
  
HEAT shells armed with high-explosive shaped charge warhead.  
  
Their armour piercing capability doesn't decrease with range, but accuracy does because of the lower projectile velocity and similar kinetic projectiles usually have a higher armour piercing capability up close.  
  
Mass 7.65 kg, explosives mass 640 g, armour penetration 90 mm.  
  
When fired from a 8,8 cm KwK 36 L/56:  
Muzzle velocity: 600 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 476 m/s, drop -4.1 m.  
1000 m: velocity 369 m/s, drop -19.4 m.  
2000 m: velocity 273 m/s, drop -114.6 m.

**Armour Piercing High Explosive Shells**  
8,8 cm Pzgr. 39  
  
Shells armed with bursting charge warhead.  
  
Good against armoured targets. In case of penetration do more damage inside the target than solid AP shells, but HE filling can detonate prematurely (for instance, when used against spaced armour plates).  
  
Mass 10.16 kg, explosives mass 64 g.  
  
When fired from a 8,8 cm KwK 36 L/56 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 800 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 140 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 129 mm, velocity 756 m/s, drop -2.2 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 119 mm, velocity 713 m/s, drop -8.6 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 100 mm, velocity 631 m/s, drop -36.3 m.

**Sub-Caliber Armour Piercing Shells**  
8,8 cm Pzgr. 40  
  
Shells armed with sub-caliber armour-piercing projectile. Good against heavily armoured targets at short ranges.  
  
8,8 cm Pzgr. 40 is a composite round - hard (tungsten alloy) penetrator inside a body made from a softer steel (for obturation inside a gun barrel).  
  
Mass: 7.3 kg, penetrator calibre 37 mm.  
  
When fired from a 8,8 cm KwK 36 L/56 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 930 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 201 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 179 mm, velocity 858 m/s, drop -1.7 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 159 mm, velocity: 791 m/s, drop -6.6 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 126 mm, velocity: 670 m/s, drop -29.1 m.

## Description

T-34 built by F.E. Dzerzhinsky Ural Tank Factory #183 (UTZ) in Spring 1943. These tanks had distinct hexagon cast turrets with sharp bilges, mixed cast (with internal dampeners) and rubber-coated wheels, and external fuel tanks at the rear. Rubber-coated wheels were introduced for better cushioning, but because of the rubber shortage in the USSR, they were mixed with older type wheels.  
  
The tank design has been simplified by reducing the number of different types of armour sheets, so sides, rear, bottom, roof and bottom above tracks armour thickness increased - 40 mm armour sheets were replaced by 45 mm ones and 13-16 mm sheets by 20 mm ones. The new cast turret also was 5-11% more durable depending on the hit angle.  
  
In addition, the tanks made during this time usually had the new 5-gear gearbox installed for more effective acceleration and cross-country capacity. Main gun ammo has been increased to 100 rounds.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
OF-350  
  
Good against soft, unarmoured or lightly armoured targets.  
  
Mass 6.2 kg, explosives mass 710 g.  
Direct hit armour penetration 20 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 3 m.  
  
When fired from a F-34 / ZiS-5 gun:  
Muzzle velocity: 680 m/s.  
500 m: velocity: 616 m/s, drop -3.0 m.  
1000 m: velocity: 558 m/s, drop -12.5 m.  
2000 m: velocity: 468 m/s, drop -56.7 m.

**8 all-steel wheels**  
Four additional internally sprung wheels (8 in total) due to shortage of rubber.

**Armour Piercing Shells**  
BR-350BSP  
  
Solid armour piercing shells without explosive filling.  
Good against spaced armour plates, but cause less damage inside a target than more advanced APHE.  
  
Mass: 6.6 kg.  
  
When fired from a F-34 / ZiS-5 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 660 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 87 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 73 mm, velocity 585 m/s, drop -3.2 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 62 mm, velocity 524 m/s, drop -13.6 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 47 mm, velocity 429 m/s, drop -63.5 m.

**Armour Piercing High Explosive Shells**  
BR-350B  
  
Shells armed with bursting charge warhead.  
Good against armoured targets. In case of penetration do more damage inside the target than solid AP shells, but HE filling can detonate prematurely (for instance, when used against spaced armour plates).  
  
Mass 6.5 kg, explosives mass 119 g.  
  
When fired from a F-34 / ZiS-5 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 660 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 86 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 72 mm, velocity 584 m/s, drop -3.2 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 61 mm, velocity 522 m/s, drop -13.6 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 46 mm, velocity 427 m/s, drop -64.0 m.

**Sub-Caliber Armour Piercing Shells**  
BR-354P  
  
Shells armed with sub-caliber armour-piercing projectile.  
  
Good against heavily armoured targets at short ranges: being much lighter than ordinary rounds, they have much higher muzzle velocity and armour penetration at close distances. However, because of the lower mass their velocity quickly diminishes with distance and they are worse than ordinary rounds at higher distances.  
  
The penetrator is held in the barrel by a spool looking sabot. While reducing the round mass for increased muzzle velocity, this makes it lose velocity even more quickly because of the air drag.  
  
Mass: 3.02 kg, penetrator calibre 28 mm.  
  
When fired from a F-34 / ZiS-5 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 950 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 129 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 90 mm, velocity 741 m/s, drop -1.7 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 60 mm, velocity: 558 m/s, drop -8.0 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 24 mm, velocity: 295 m/s, drop -53.3 m.

**6 all-steel wheels**  
Two additional internally sprung wheels (6 in total) due to shortage of rubber.

**Removed Fuel Tanks**  
The external rear-mounted fuel tanks oftenly were removed.

## Description

SU-152 heavy assault gun has been produced at the Kirov tank factory in Chelyabinsk (ChKZ) from February 1943 till January 1944. 670 units were produced in total.   
  
The assault gun was built on KV-1s tank chassis, so its engine compartment remained the same while the fighting and driving compartments were new. It had only one weapon installed - 152mm ML-20 all-purpose gun. The crew compartment was wider than the hull but was armored good enough. Its array of aiming instruments included the telescopic gunsight for direct fire, gunner's panoramic gunsight with an independent line of sight and PTK-5 panoramic visor for the commander.  
  
During the Kursk battle, SU-152 was the only Soviet armoured vehicle capable of engaging the newest German heavy tanks at 1.5-2 km distances.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
OF-540  
  
Good against soft, unarmoured or lightly armoured targets.  
  
Mass 43.56 kg, explosives mass 6.25 kg.  
Direct hit armour penetration 60 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 8 m.  
  
When fired from a ML-20S gun:  
Muzzle velocity: 655 m/s.  
500 m: velocity: 630 m/s, drop -3.0 m.  
1000 m: velocity: 605 m/s, drop -12.4 m.  
2000 m: velocity: 560 m/s, drop -51.6 m.

**Armour Piercing High Explosive Shells**  
BR-540  
  
Shells armed with bursting charge warhead.  
Good against armoured targets. In case of penetration do more damage inside the target than solid AP shells, but HE filling can detonate prematurely (for instance, when used against spaced armour plates).  
  
Mass 48.78 kg, explosives mass 1.2 kg.  
  
When fired from a ML-20S gun:  
Muzzle velocity 600 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 138 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 131 mm, velocity 578 m/s, drop -3.7 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 124 mm, velocity 557 m/s, drop -14.7 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 111 mm, velocity 516 m/s, drop -60.1 m.

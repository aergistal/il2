## Description

Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf.L was equipped with 50 mm main gun that has a good armour penetration ability and additional 20 mm thick armour plates on the gun mantlet and front hull. These improvements were introduced when Germans encountered Soviet T-34 and KV tanks.

## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
5 cm Sprgr. 38  
  
Good against soft, unarmored or lightly armored targets.  
  
Mass 1.81 kg, explosives mass 175 g.  
  
Direct hit armour penetration 11 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 1.5 m.  
  
When fired from a 5 cm KwK 39 L/60 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 550 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 444 m/s, drop -4.9 m.  
1000 m: velocity 368 m/s, drop -22.6 m.  
2000 m: velocity 285 m/s, drop -118.5 m.

**Armour Piercing High Explosive Shells**  
5 cm Pzgr. 39  
  
Shells armed with bursting charge warhead.  
  
Good against armoured targets. In case of penetration do more damage inside the target than solid AP shells, but HE filling can detonate prematurely (for instance, when used against spaced armour plates).  
  
Mass 2.06 kg, explosives mass 17 g.  
  
When fired from a 5 cm KwK 39 L/60 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 835 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 87 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 68 mm, velocity 702 m/s, drop -1.5 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 53 mm, velocity 587 m/s, drop -8.4 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 30 mm, velocity 394 m/s, drop -76.7 m.

**Sub-Caliber Armour Piercing Shells**  
5 cm Pzgr. 40  
  
Shells armed with sub-caliber armour-piercing projectile.  
  
Good against heavily armoured targets at short ranges: being much lighter than ordinary rounds, they have much higher muzzle velocity and armour penetration at close distances. However, because of the lower mass their velocity quickly diminishes with distance and they are worse than ordinary rounds at higher distances.  
  
The penetrator is held in the barrel by a spool looking sabot. While reducing the round mass for increased muzzle velocity, this makes it lose velocity even more quickly because of the air drag.  
  
Mass: 0.925 kg, penetrator calibre 21 mm.  
  
When fired from a 5 cm KwK 39 L/60 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 1180 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 175 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 82 mm, velocity 696 m/s, drop -2.1 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 43 mm, velocity: 443 m/s, drop -9.2 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 16 mm, velocity: 223 m/s, drop -49.0 m.

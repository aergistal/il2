## Modifications

**High-Explosive Shells**  
2 cm Spgr.Patr.  
  
Good against soft, unarmoured or lightly armoured targets.  
  
Mass 115 g, explosives mass 6 g.  
Self-destroying (they explode after 6 seconds at roughly 2000 m range).  
Direct hit armour penetration 3 mm, effective damage distance for light vehicles 1 m.  
  
When fired from a Flak 38 gun:  
Muzzle velocity: 880 m/s.  
500 m: velocity 634 m/s, drop -2.1 m.  
1000 m: velocity 373 m/s, drop -11.0 m.  
2000 m: velocity 245 m/s, drop -95.8 m.

**Armour Piercing Shells**  
2 cm Pzgr. L'spur  
  
Solid armour piercing shells without explosive filling.  
Good against spaced armour plates, but cause less damage inside a target than more advanced APHE.  
  
Mass: 148 g.  
  
When fired from a Flak 38 gun:  
Muzzle velocity 780 m/s, armour penetration at point blank range 25 mm.  
500 m: armour penetration 16 mm, velocity 561 m/s, drop -2.7 m.  
1000 m: armour penetration 9 mm, velocity 393 m/s, drop -13.6 m.  
2000 m: armour penetration 5 mm, velocity 264 m/s, drop -96.1 m.

**Remove gunsight shield**  
Removing the gunsight shield gives the gunner a slightly wider field of view.

**Remove both gun shields**  
Gun shields are completely removed for an improved field of view.
